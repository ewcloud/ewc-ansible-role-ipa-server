# IPA Sever Ansible Role

This repository contains a configuration template 
(i.e. an [Ansible Role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)) 
to customize your environment in the
[European Weather Cloud (EWC)](https://europeanweather.cloud/).
The template is designed to:
* Validate that network/subnet configuration in the EWC tenancy, that is OpenStack
security group rules, is suitable for IPA server operation (e.g. open ports for 
DNS, LDAP, Kerberos, HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, etc.)
* Check that target host has the recommended RAM availability
* Configure a pre-existing RockyLinux 8 or RockyLinux 9 virtual machine such that it:
  * Provides DNS resolutions for discovery of resources (i.e. other virtual machines)
  * Enables centralized user and credentials creation/edition/deletion/authentication
  * Allows centralized authorization between users and resources
* Automatically update the underlying subnet DNS nameserver to point to the newly configured IPA server

## Authentication

Before proceeding, if you lack OpenStack Application Credentials or do not know
how to make them available to Ansible in your development environment, make sure
to check out the 
[EWC documentation](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/EWCLOUDKB/EWC+-+How+to+request+Openstack+Application+Credentials).

## Usage

The step-by-step described below assume your local file system follows the 
example structure below, with `ewc-ansible-role-ipa-server` being a clone of this
repository:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ roles
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ewc-ansible-role-ipa-server
â”œâ”€â”€ inventory.yml
â””â”€â”€ playbook.yml
```

### 1. Specify the target host and SSH credentials
Create an inventory file to specify address/credentials that Ansible should use
to reach the virtual machine you wish to configure:
```yaml
# inventory.yml
---
ewcloud:
  hosts:
    ipa_server:
      ansible_python_interpreter: /usr/bin/python3
      ansible_host: <add the IPV4 address of the target host>
      ansible_ssh_private_key_file: <add the path to local SSH RSA private key file>
      ansible_user: <add the username which owns the SSH RSA private key >
```
### 2. Customize the template

Edit input values for the template [variables](./vars/main.yml) as needed (see
[Inputs](#inputs) section for details).
Then, proceed to create an Ansible Playbook file to load your customizations: 

```yaml
# playbook.yml
---
- name: Deploy IPA Server on RockyLinux
  hosts: ipa_server
  become: true
  become_user: root
  become_method: ansible.builtin.sudo

  roles:
    - ewc-ansible-role-ipa-server

```

### 3. Apply the template

You can apply changes on the target host by running:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml playbook.yml
```

| os_subnet_dns_nameserver_ip_fallback | fallback DNS nameserver IPV4 address registered on the OpenStack subnet where the IPA server will run. Example: `8.8.8.8` | `string` | n/a  | yes |


## Final Environment

### RockyLinux 8 Environment

Applying this template will trigger the installation of the following 
open-source packages onto your desired target RockyLinux 8 host:

| Name | Version | License | Package Info |

| firewalld | 0.9 | GPLv2+ | http://www.firewalld.org |
| ipa-server | 4.9 | GPLv3+ | http://www.freeipa.org |
| ipa-server-dns | 4.9 | GPLv3+ | http://www.freeipa.org |
| bind-dyndb-ldap | 11.6 | GPLv2+ | https://releases.pagure.org/bind-dyndb-ldap |

### RockyLinux 9 Environment

Likewise, on your desired target RockyLinux 9 host, the template will trigger
installation of the following open-source packages:

| Name | Version | License | Package Info |
|------|---------|---------|--------------|
| firewalld | 1.3 | GPLv2+ | http://www.firewalld.org |
| ipa-server | 4.12 | GPLv3+ | http://www.freeipa.org/ |
